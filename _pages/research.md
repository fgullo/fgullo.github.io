Francesco's research falls into the broad areas of *artificial intelligence* and *data science*, with special emphasis on *algorithmic* aspects, i.e., on *formulating*, *theoretically characterizing*, and *designing effective yet efficient algorithms* for (novel) problems that are useful to gain insights/information/knowledge from data.
As far as data types, special emphasis has been given to *graphs*, *text*, and *temporal data*, but he has also dealt with tabular data, probabilistic data, and semistructured data.
*Large-scale data processing* and *combinatorial optimization* are frequently-occurring keywords in his work.


More specifically, his recent research interests include:

* Graph learning
    + graph representation learning (a.k.a. graph embedding); graph neural networks; machine/graph learning for combinatorial optimization; deep/reinforcement learning paradigms for graph clustering; graph classification;
* Combinatorial optimization on graphs
    + dense-subgraph discovery; graph summarization; reachability/distance queries on graphs; graph pattern mining; graph clustering; querying graph databases; link prediction;
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    + large language models; natural language generation; question answering; word embeddings; text classification; information extraction from text; sentiment analysis/transfer; text summarization; entity recognition and disambiguation;
* Ethics and trustworthiness in data management and AI (algorithmic fairness, explainable AI, interpretability, transparency, privacy, responsible AI, sustainable AI)
* AI in finance

Other topics/problems he has focused on in the past include (*social*) *Web mining* (e.g., discovering polarized communities, social-network analysis, information propagation in online services, community search/detection, social-influence analysis, personalization of online services), *mining high-dimensional and multifaceted data* (i.e., projective/subspace clustering, clustering ensembles, projective clustering ensembles), *uncertainty in data mining & machine learning*, *time-series data management*, *bioinformatics*, *XML data management*.
