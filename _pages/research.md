Francesco's research falls into the broad areas of *artificial intelligence* and *data science*, with special emphasis on *algorithmic* aspects, i.e., on *formulating*, *theoretically characterizing*, and *designing effective yet efficient algorithms* for (novel) problems that are useful to gain insights/information/knowledge from data.
As far as data types, special emphasis has been given to *graphs*, *text*, and *temporal data*, but he has also dealt with Euclidean data, probabilistic data, and semistructured data.
*Large-scale data processing* and *combinatorial optimization* are frequently-occurring keywords in his work.


More specifically, his recent research interests include:

* Mining and learning on graphs
    + graph embedding; graph neural networks; explainability in graph learning; graph similarity learning; mining and learning on blockchain graphs; dense-subgraph discovery; mining/querying information-rich graphs (e.g., temporal/knowledge//multi-layer/uncertain graphs); reachability/distance queries on graphs; graph pattern mining; graph clustering; querying graph databases; link prediction
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    + word embeddings; privacy-preserving text analysis; sentiment analysis; text summarization; document categorization; entity recognition and disambiguation; information extraction from text
* AI in finance
* (Social) Web mining
    + social-network analysis;  information propagation in online services;  community search/detection;  social-influence analysis;  personalization of online services;  log analysis 

In the past he has also focused on topics/problems such as *mining high-dimensional and multifaceted data* (i.e., projective/subspace clustering, clustering ensembles, projective clustering ensembles), *uncertainty in data mining & machine learning*, *time-series data management*, *bioinformatics*, *XML data management*.
