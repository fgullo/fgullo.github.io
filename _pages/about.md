Previously, he has been part of the "*Research & Development*" department ([UniCredit](https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en/worldwide/our-worldwide-presence/europe/italy/unicredit.html) holding company) for 5 years.
He received his PhD, in "*Computer and Systems Engineering*", from the [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it), Italy, in 2010. 
During his PhD, he was an *intern* at the [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu), USA.
