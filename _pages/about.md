Francesco Gullo is a *senior associate researcher* at the [UniCredit](https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en.html) banking group.
He joined UniCredit in 2015, and, since then, he has been part of departments/units focusing on research and development in the areas of artificial intelligence and data science: the "*R&D*" department first (for 5 years), the "*Applied Research & Innovation*" unit of the "*AI, Data & Analytics ICT*" department then (for 2 years), and the "*Group Data & Intelligence*" department now (since September 2022).
He received his PhD, in "*Computer and Systems Engineering*", from the [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it)  (Italy), in 2010. 
During his PhD, he was an *intern* at the [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu) (US), and a teaching/research assistant at the University of Catanzaro (Italy).
After his graduation, he was a *postdoc* at the University of Calabria (Italy),  a *postdoc* and a *research scientist* at the *Yahoo Labs* (Spain), and a *research scientist* at the *Fundacio Barcelona Media* (Spain).
<br>
His research falls into the broad areas of *artificial intelligence* and *data science*, with emphasis on *algorithmic* aspects, i.e., on formulating novel problems, theoretically characterizing them, and designing/analyzing algorithms.
His recent interests include *graph machine learning*, *graph data management*, *natural language processing*, and *trustworthy AI*.
He has been practicing both *fundamental research* (~90 publications, mostly in premier venues such as SIGMOD, VLDB, KDD, ICDM, CIKM, EDBT, WSDM, ECML-PKDD, SDM, TODS, TKDE, TKDD, MACH, DAMI, JCSS, TNSE, PR), and *applied research* ($12$-year work experience in industrial-research environments).
<br>
He has also been serving the scientific community: he was/is/will be Finance Chair of CIKM'24, Workshop Chair of ICDM'16, Program co-Chair of [MIDAS workshop](http://midas.portici.enea.it) @ECML-PKDD['16-'23], MultiClust symposium @SDM'14, MultiClust workshop @KDD'13, 3Clust workshop @PAKDD'12), as well as (senior) program-committee member of major conferences, including SIGMOD, KDD, WWW, IJCAI, AAAI, CIKM, SIGIR, ICDM, WSDM, SDM, ECML-PKDD, ECAI, ICWSM.
