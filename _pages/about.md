Francesco Gullo is a *researcher* at [UniCredit](https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en.html">UniCredit), R&D department. 
He received his PhD, in "*Computer and Systems Engineering*", from the [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it), Italy, in 2010. 
During his PhD, he was an *intern* at the [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu), Fairfax VA, USA. 
Before joining UniCredit, he spent 1.5 years in the *University of Calabria*, Italy (as a *postdoc*), and 4 years in the *Yahoo Labs*, Spain (as a *postdoc* first, and as a *research scientist* then).

As a researcher, he has a twofold nature:
he has been practicing both *applied research* (with a ~10-year work experience in industrial-research environments), and *fundamental research* (with >70 publications and a well-established impact within the scientific community).
<br>
His research falls into the broad areas of *artificial intelligence* and *data science*, with special emphasis on *algorithmic* aspects, i.e., on formulating novel problems, theoretically characterizing them, and designing/analyzing algorithms for their solution.
His work has been published in premier venues in the areas of AI, data science, machine learning, databases, Web data management, and NLP, including SIGMOD, VLDB, KDD, ICDM, CIKM, EDBT, WSDM, ECML-PKDD, SDM, TODS, TKDE, TKDD, Machine Learning, DAMI, JCSS, Pattern Recognition.
<br>
He has also been active in serving the scientific community, by, e.g., being Workshop Chair of ICDMâ€™16, organizing [MIDAS workshop](http://midas.portici.enea.it) @ECML-PKDD['16-'20], MultiClust mini-symposium @SDM'14, MultiClust workshop @KDD'13, 3Clust workshop @PAKDD'12), or being stably part of the program committee of major AI/data-science conferences (e.g., KDD, WWW, IJCAI, CIKM, SIGIR, ICDM, WSDM, SDM, ECML-PKDD, ICWSM).
