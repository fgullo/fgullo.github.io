Francesco Gullo is a researcher at UniCredit, R&D department. He received his PhD from the University of Calabria, Italy, in 2010. During his PhD, he was an intern at the George Mason University, Fairfax VA, USA. Before joining UniCredit, he spent 1.5 years in the University of Calabria, Italy (as a postdoc), and 4 years in the Yahoo Labs, Spain (as a postdoc first, and as a research scientist then).
His research is focused on algorithmic data science, i.e., on formulating novel problems to gain in- sights/information/knowledge from data, theoretically characterizing them, and designing/analyzing effective yet efficient algorithms for their solution. As far as data types, special emphasis has been given to graphs, text, and time series, but he has also dealt with Euclidean data, probabilistic data, and semistructured data. Large-scale data processing and combinatorial optimization are frequently-occurring keywords in his work. His research has been published in premier venues in the areas of data mining, machine learning, databases, Web data manage- ment, and NLP, including SIGMOD, VLDB, KDD, ICDM, CIKM, EDBT, WSDM, ECML-PKDD, SDM, TODS, TKDE, TKDD, Machine Learning, DAMI, JCSS, Pattern Recognition.
He has also been active in serving the data-science scientific community, by, e.g., being Workshop Chair of ICDM’16, organizing workshops/symposia (MIDAS workshop @ECML-PKDD[’16-’19], MultiClust mini- symposium @SDM’14, MultiClust workshop @KDD’13, 3Clust workshop @PAKDD’12), or being part of the program committee of major conferences (KDD, WWW, IJCAI-PRICAI, ICDM, WSDM, ECML-PKDD, CIKM, SIGIR, ICWSM, SDM).
