Francesco Gullo is a *researcher* at [UniCredit](https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en.html">UniCredit), R&D department. 
He received his PhD, in "*Computer and Systems Engineering*", from the [University of Calabria](https://www.unical.it), Italy, in 2010. 
During his PhD, he was an *intern* at the [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu), Fairfax VA, USA. 
Before joining UniCredit, he spent 1.5 years in the *University of Calabria*, Italy (as a *postdoc*), and 4 years in the *Yahoo Labs*, Spain (as a *postdoc* first, and as a *research scientist* then).
<br>
His research falls into the broad areas of *artificial intelligence* and *data science*, with special emphasis on *algorithmic* aspects, i.e., on formulating novel problems, theoretically characterizing them, and designing/analyzing algorithms for their solution.
His recent interests include *mining and learning on graphs*, *natural language processing*, *AI in finance*, and *(social) Web mining*.
He has been practicing both *applied research* (with a ~10-year work experience in industrial-research environments), and *fundamental research* (with ~80 publications in premier venues such as SIGMOD, VLDB, KDD, ICDM, CIKM, EDBT, WSDM, ECML-PKDD, SDM, TODS, TKDE, TKDD, MACH, DAMI, TNSE, JCSS, PR).
<br>
He has also been active in serving the scientific community, by, e.g., being Workshop Chair of ICDMâ€™16, organizing workshops/symposia ([MIDAS workshop](http://midas.portici.enea.it) @ECML-PKDD['16-'20], MultiClust symposium @SDM'14, MultiClust workshop @KDD'13, 3Clust workshop @PAKDD'12), or being stably part of the program committee of major AI/data-science conferences (e.g., KDD, WWW, IJCAI, AAAI, CIKM, SIGIR, ICDM, WSDM, SDM, ECML-PKDD, ICWSM).
